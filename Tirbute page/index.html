                    He joined the Faculty of Science, Alexandria University after obtaining high school, and obtained a Bachelor of Science with distinction with honors in 1967 in chemistry, and worked as a teaching assistant at the faculty,
                    then obtained a master's degree in research in the science of light.

                    and received his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in laser sciences. 
                    He then worked as a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley (1974-1976). Then he moved to work at the California Institute of Technology since 1976, 
                    which is one of the largest scientific universities in the United States of America.

                    He obtained American citizenship in 1982. He rose to academic positions within Caltech University until he became a principal professor of chemistry at Caltech, the highest university scientific position in the United States of America, succeeding Linus Pauling, who won the Nobel Prize twice; The first is in chemistry and the second is in world peace.
